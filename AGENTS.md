# AGENTS.md

Read `README.md` before working in this repo — especially the
[Modifying the editor](README.md#modifying-the-editor) section for **any**
change to mob proto structs, types, fields, flags, or locales. It lists the
exact tables to touch and the cookbook for each kind of change.

Hard invariants:

1. **Never edit `support.js`.** It is a generated dc-runtime bundle; the whole
   app lives in `index.html`.
2. **`COLS` and `HEADERS` must stay index-aligned** (71 columns). A new field
   also needs `DEFAULTS`, `FIELD`, and a `GROUPS` entry — five places total
   (see README § Add a proto column). New columns only at index ≥ 2; columns
   0–1 (`vnum`, `nameK`) are special-cased in parse/export.
3. **Mob flag fields are comma-separated** (`sep:','` in `FIELD`) — never
   hardcode the `|` joiner.
4. **No build step.** Verify changes by opening `index.html` in a browser and
   clicking **Sample**, then Export and inspect the output columns.
